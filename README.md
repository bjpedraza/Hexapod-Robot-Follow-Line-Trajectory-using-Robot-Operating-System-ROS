# Hexapod Robot: Follow Line Trajectory using Robot Operating System (ROS)
Hexapod robot that follows black line using OpenCV and Hough Line Transformation

## Robot and Componets
The robot that was built and used was the Adeept hexapod robot.
The hardware used for this robot was a Raspberry Pi 3. 
The Raspberry Pi was mounted with a Pi Camera, an Adeept Robot Hat, and a MPU6050 Gyro Sensor along with six legs.
In total, fourteen servos were used to control the robot, with two for each leg and an additional two for the neck (up and down) of the robot.
